# Submitting Data

Currently, you can learn how to interact with Melodot from the Rust examples. We anticipate that some interfaces will be modified once the light nodes are released. At that time, we will update with more powerful interfaces.

## Example
1. [Connect to Melodot](https://github.com/ZeroDAO/melodot/blob/main/crates/meloxt/examples/header.rs).
2. [Register the application](https://github.com/ZeroDAO/melodot/blob/main/crates/meloxt/examples/register_app.rs).
3. [Call the submit_data interface](https://github.com/ZeroDAO/melodot/blob/main/crates/meloxt/examples/submit_data.rs).
4. [Use the submit_blob_tx RPC](https://github.com/ZeroDAO/melodot/blob/main/crates/meloxt/examples/submit_blob_tx.rs).
