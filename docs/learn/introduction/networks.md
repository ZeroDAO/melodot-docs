## OverTrue Development Testnet

Explorer: [https://scan.melodot.io/](https://scan.melodot.io/)

OverTrue is a development testnet designed to provide a usable testing environment in phases. It will undergo rapid iterations and may be reset without prior notice. Currently, we are not operating a sufficient number of farmers, so data availability cannot be guaranteed. However, a full-featured version is expected to be launched soon, entering the official testing phase of OverTrue.
